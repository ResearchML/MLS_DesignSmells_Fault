SMTInterpol does not allow some symbol names that are
not SMT-LIB2-compliant (e.g., ""select"", ""and"", ""true"").
It also does not allow symbolnames containing ""|"" or plain ""\"".
Other solvers would even allow such symbol names.
To have a uniform API with exchangeable solvers,
we completely disallow such symbol names.

This change might break use cases in existing software,
where any possible String was used as symbol name.
To avoid problems, developers might want to escape
such special symbol names with a given prefix or escape-symbol.   ,  do no longer allow mathematical operators as symbol names.

We do no longer accept special names as identifiers for variables or UFs,
because they easily misguide the user.   ,  move constants representing invalid names from Formula into FormulaManager.

SMTInterpol does not allow some symbol names that are
not SMT-LIB2-compliant (e.g., ""select"", ""and"", ""true"").
It also does not allow symbolnames containing ""|"" or plain ""\"".
Other solvers would even allow such symbol names.
To have a uniform API with exchangeable solvers,
we completely disallow such symbol names.

This change might break use cases in existing software,
where any possible String was used as symbol name.
To avoid problems, developers might want to escape
such special symbol names with a given prefix or escape-symbol.   ,  improve test for invalid names.   ,  fix for last commit.

Forgotten negation in check and test.   ,  improve tests for symbol names.

Current status:
- all solvers allow Strings as names and use them ""AS IS"".
- the toString-methods of some solvers are broken,
i.e., they quote if needed, but do not double quote already quoted Strings.
- some solvers do not allow special names,
i.e., SMTInterpol does not like ""|"" or ""\\"" due to internal logging.   ,  move constants representing invalid names from Formula into FormulaManager.

And provide a (currently unused) method in the API,
such that users can validate their names before using them.   ,  add JUnit-test for equal behavior of 'checkVariableName' and 'isValidName'.   ,  "

The example is roughly based on the implementation of Daniel B.,

It also ignores several problematic parts, such as
exceptions (simply thrown, we cannot handle them here anyway)
