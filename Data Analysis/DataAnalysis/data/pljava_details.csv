What the TypeMapper was doing was correct for a function return value,
matching the return value to the narrowest mapped type that the actual
return value could be assigned to.

It was not correct for a function parameter, which needs to be matched
to the widest mapped type that could be assigned to the parameter.

Jens, if you ever read this, forgive me. At least I caught it quickly.   ,  Snippet implicitly requires its implementor-name.

That way, a snippet that will test some condition and enable that
implementor-name at install time can be declared to provide it, and
be emitted earlier. However, not to insist on supplying a snippet
that explicitly provides every implementor name ... some could just
be selected by the user with SET LOCAL pljava.implementors TO ...
before installing. So the implicit requirement will be counted in
indegree initially, to delay such a snippet as far as practical, but
only until a cycle-breaker releases it when no other progress can
be made.   ,  SQL generator now reports require cycles usefully.

Should have done that all along.   ,  Now Snippet can carry implementor-name.

Nothing sets it yet, but it now defaults to PostgreSQL for everything, in
recognition of the fact that hardly any of the PG SQL code that gets
generated here will be in the exact ISO-prescribed syntax of the exact
five allowed, unadorned SQL statements.

Yes, that makes DDR files bigger. The zip format will compress them well.   ,  Changes are required because of move of GETSTRUCT() and timeout
handling framework changes done in PG 9.3. Along with that I fixes
minor issue in DDRProcessor.java that is causing ""illegal start of
expression"" error. Maven did not worked for me to build it and hang
endlessly while building c source code (pljava-so). As a workaround I
temporarily fixed makefiles to test PG9.3 related fix that seems
worked and generated pljava.jar and pljava.so files and their basic
sanity seems working fine.   ,  Add a class annotation to make a base/scalar UDT.

- Add the annotation, have DDRProcessor recognize it.
- Check the annotated class for the required properties and members.
- The snippets map formerly allowed only one type of annotation on
  a given element. That happened to work, but not now when a class
  could have both a UDT and a SQLAction annotation, for example.
  Adapt the map to key by element and snippet class, so snippets
  of different classes can be hung on an element and selectively
  retrieved.
- An old comment in populateAnnotationImpl suggested it would reduce
  boilerplate setter code if, failing to find a setter method, the
  field itself could be reflectively looked up and stored. That's done
  now, so setter methods are needed only when something more special
  has to be done.
- Function declarations will be synthesized automagically for the four
  mandatory (in, out, recv, send) methods, but to allow their properties
  to be individually adjusted, they can still accept Function
  annotations. That's done by hanging a new subclass of FunctionImpl on
  those elements, that generates the right special form of declaration,
  and has setters that refuse changes to certain properties where that
  wouldn't make sense.
- Treat the default implementor-tag (PostgreSQL if not changed with new
  ddr.implementor command line property) specially. Now that everything
  is getting wrapped with an implementor tag by default, the implied
  requires=""implementor-tag"" was holding everything back until released
  by the cycle-breaker, sometimes in puzzling order. The implementor tag
  that happens to be the default one should /not/ be treated as a
  pending requirement.
- Move ComplexScalar to annotation subpackage, in preparation for
  revamping it as an annotation example. So git won't lose track of it,
  this is a breaking change, to be fixed in the next commit with edits
  corresponding to the move.   ,  Conform to BaseUDT rename, add MappedUDT.

Supporting MappedUDT is much simpler. It emits a
CREATE TYPE foo AS ( ... structure ... )
if a structure is provided, or not, if it isn't, followed by a
SELECT sqlj.add_type_mapping( ... ), and that's it.

Much javadoc also added.

This commit ends with pure renames of the Point and ComplexTuple
examples in preparation to make them annotation examples ... breaking
compilation until they are fixed up in the next commit, but git can
see where they went.   ,  Workaround the problem reported in #39.

The annotation processor in javac runs in multiple 'rounds', as long as
generated source files keep appearing, and one final round after they
don't. This code used to save some mapping of Class objects to the
javax.lang.model objects (TypeElement/TypeMirror) until the final round,
which worked in Java 6, but as of 7 one gets back different model objects
in different rounds, for the same types, and they don't match, so type
mapping breaks.

This workaround moves all those lookups to before or during round 1, when
a consistent set of model objects can be looked up. So, it will work as
long as all the source files that might contain pljava annotations will be
found in round 1. That should always be the case unless someone is using a
very fancy build with _other_ annotation processors generating new source
files with pljava annotations that have to be processed in additional
rounds. For now, that won't work, because their types won't seem to match
what was computed in round 1. So don't do that.

http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8038455 might refer
to this problem, and promises a fix in Java 9, for what it's worth.   ,  Update annotation-driven SQL generation to Java 6.

Remove the dependency on org.objectweb.asm in favor of the
annotation processing facilities now built in to javac as of
Java 6. Add annotations to override the auto-determined type
for function parameters and/or supply default values, and to
supply arbitrary SQL commands to be included in the generated
deployment descriptor.   ,  "

In a couple last this-really-has-to-be-it review passes...

- some msg() calls had the Element parameter in the wrong place (and,
  being variadic and expecting extra parameters, didn't warn about it).
- whether to include length/alignment/storage in the output when 'like'
  is used should explicitly depend on whether they were set explicitly
  (is that explicit enough?); otherwise, in some cases it wouldn't be
  possible to override the values copied by like.

That's how it was declared in the hand-maintained examples.ddr, and
letting it default to VOLATILE makes it produce TupleDesc reference
leak warnings for some reason, so I've added IMMUTABLE to the annotation.

At the same time, onNullInput=RETURNS_NULL is clearly needed, just by
glancing at the function, which does no null checking. That's also true
of Point, so that's added both places. This demonstrates an advantage of

Completes the work on MappedUDT, with Point and ComplexTuple now
annotation examples, and the corresponding code removed from the
old hand-maintained examples.ddr.

In a couple last this-really-has-to-be-it review passes...

- some msg() calls had the Element parameter in the wrong place (and,
  being variadic and expecting extra parameters, didn't warn about it).
- whether to include length/alignment/storage in the output when 'like'
  is used should explicitly depend on whether they were set explicitly
  (is that explicit enough?); otherwise, in some cases it wouldn't be
  possible to override the values copied by like.
- removed a goofy constant in the VarlenaUDTTest left over from very
  early sanity checking.
- Shortened unnecessary full-qualification on some enums actually in
  scope.   ,  ComplexTuple.logAndReturn needs IMMUTABLE.

That's how it was declared in the hand-maintained examples.ddr, and
letting it default to VOLATILE makes it produce TupleDesc reference
leak warnings for some reason, so I've added IMMUTABLE to the annotation.

At the same time, onNullInput=RETURNS_NULL is clearly needed, just by
glancing at the function, which does no null checking. That's also true
of Point, so that's added both places. This demonstrates an advantage of
the SQL generation ... the place where you put the annotation is exactly
where you're looking when you're looking at the code.   ,  Change annotation keywords discussed on -dev.

For now, nothing done but to dump the annotated examples in with
the other ones (and change the name of one method that duplicated
one of the non-annotated ones), and further annotate the trigger
example to create the tables it refers to. (Also, one example
referred to an example.properties file, so one has been created.)

For now, the result is a jar with two deployment descriptors (which
is supposed to be ok per SQL/JRT 2003, so is now accepted): the
original one and the generated one.

Notes on things I know aren't perfect yet:

1. Maven doesn't put things in the jar in a deterministic order.
The generated ddr depends on the javatest schema and _properties
type created in the old ddr, but sometimes ""mvn clean install"" will
put the two ddrs in the jar in the other order. This is just a
maven issue; pljava correctly follows the spec and uses the order of
the ddrs found in the jar. It wouldn't be a problem if the two ddrs
had no interdependencies, or if the maven build could be tweaked
to force a certain order in the jar, or if the old ddr were done away
with entirely by annotating all the old examples so the generator
generates everything.

2. The generated ddr only reflects annotations seen in the compile run.
If a non-clean build run only runs javac on a few changed files, the
generated ddr can be incomplete. So for now it's best to run javac on
everything (or do a mvn clean before building). There may be a way to
improve the annotation processor to save a record of all the files that
would need to be reexamined in a partial rebuild. What I don't know yet
is how (or whether) that can be communicated back to javac to get those
files examined in a later round.

3. Naturally until issue #8 is fixed, none of the no-arg example
functions can actually be used.

4. The old examples.ddr contains a set search_path making javatest the
current schema, which causes deployRemove to fail later. The trouble is
that if deployRemove alters the search path on the current schema, it will
try to restore the old value after undeploying, and that fails if the
undeploy made that schema go away. Possibly deployRemove could be made to
just fail silently if that happens, but that's an issue for another day.   ,  "

Code changes to allow compilation and linking with Microsoft
Visual C. Maven build process conditionalized to to detect Visual C
and adjust options appropriately. See msvc-build-notes.txt for
full details. Property names updated for clarity   ,  Add a GUC option for libjvm location.

The linker used to embed a dependency for libjvm into the pljava shared
object, which required using one of several system-specific ways to get
the system's library loader (not PostgreSQL's) to be able to find libjvm,
or loading pljava would simply fail.

By omitting the linked-in dependency on libjvm, pljava can now successfully
load and then use PostgreSQL's own dlopen wrapper to find libjvm using the
pljava.libjvm_location option, or give a helpful error report.

The history of PGDLLEXPORT through the years has been
somewhat bewildering, and it begins to seem tidier to cleanly define
a PLJAVADLLEXPORT that is used only here and doesn't change its meaning
across PG releases.   ,  PL/Java as a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension.

Because PL/Java installation is already touched off by a simple
library LOAD (even on pre-9.1 databases without the extension
framework), extension support is largely a matter of having
extension scripts that touch off a LOAD. But the library does need
to detect that case and change some behaviors slightly. When LOAD
is used directly and something fails because the settings aren't
right, Backend reports a WARNING rather than an ERROR, to make it
as easy as possible to keep explore settings and eventually get them
right, without forcing a rollback. However, under CREATE EXTENSION,
it must be reported as an error, or the extension machinery will
think all is well.

Also, playing with the settings after CREATE EXTENSION failed can
result in getting PL/Java successfully installed but not as an
extension--easily remedied with CREATE EXTENSION FROM UNPACKAGED,
so a NOTICE suggesting that is reported in that case.

The method of finding the module pathname from the LOAD argument
doesn't work under CREATE EXTENSION (ActivePortal still refers to
the CREATE EXTENSION command itself, not the LOAD command in the
script), so as a workaround the script creates a temporary table
with the module pathname in it. This turns out to be useful anyway,
because it allows distinguishing the case of PL/Java itself being
installed by CREATE EXTENSION from the case where PL/Java is already
installed and its library is getting loaded in passing during
CREATE EXTENSION for something that depends on it. (Actual support
for PL/Java-managed extensions will have to come later, but the
case needs to be recognized even to say ""you can't do that yet."")

Reorganized the archives created by pljava-packaging so files are
at directory prefixes like pljava/pkglibdir, pljava/sharedir, etc.
That makes it easy to know where things should go in a manual
installation, but also opens the possibility of a self-extracting
archive that will use pg_config to look up the corresponding paths
at extraction time.   ,  MSVC profile using profile more, properties less.

This will have to be tested by someone with MSVC access. Its behavior
should be close to what I _think_ it should do. Possible nits: it puts
the MSVC extra include paths late in the list; if that's a problem
because they need to be early, I found syntax for that too, only a
little bit uglier. Also, an MSVC link will mention libjvm twice, once
in the right place (I think), but also still in the wrong one; I _think_
that should be harmless. Nothing another barrage of XML can't fix, if
it's a problem.   ,  Proclaim a default for pljava.classpath.

There may as well be an understood place to put the jar file so
the variable need not always be set.   ,  Workaround Windows creating_extension visibility.

Should now detect (in most cases?) when an extension is
being created, even in versions where creating_extension
isn't visible in Windows. Test depends on seeing the command
in ActivePortal; I am not sure what contexts could be contrived
where that wouldn't work right, but ordinary foreseeable cases
seem to work.

Got rid of pljavaInExtension: the idea that two cases have to be
distinguished (loading PL/Java itself as an extension, or using it
in the creation of some other extension) was sound, but the second
case isn't something that can be checked once at load time; it needs
a backend function that sqlj.install_jar can invoke whenever needed.   ,  Begin improving message helpfulness.

Some GUC hooks allow easily resuming the process if a setting
needed to be changed (as LOAD is a no-op after the first time,
so that isn't a way to try again).   ,  Begin new build and installation instructions.

Also document the existing examples, and add a new one, a fully worked
hello, world to demonstrate building, install_jar, and set_classpath.

Also add pljava.enable to simplify <9.2 installs, as explained in the
docs.

Alter the errhint for saving the settings in the <9.2 case.
Saving the settings with ALTER DATABASE ... SET won't work there, they
have to go in postgresql.conf.

Also masks the exact postgresql.conf path if the user isn't superuser.
I'm fairly sure there's no code path to produce this message if the user
isn't superuser, but a simple check is more readable than a proof.   ,  Conditional DDR as proposed on pljava-dev.

Delayed by a nice pljava trivia brain teaser ... IF a function's
SQL declaration says it's immutable (or even stable, I guess), AND
you call it from the deployment descriptor install commands of the
jar that contains it, AND that's the first reference you've made to
its containing class ... ClassNotFoundException. Go ahead, explain THAT
one to Aunt Tillie.... (Hint: SPI change visibility rules.)   ,  Add InstallHelper to keep hairy code from Backend.

Executive decision: attempts to ""finish"" the installation (creating
schema, language handlers, etc.) will only be made in the LOAD case.
In any other case where initialization is requested, assume things are
already set up, or explicitly being set up.   ,  Factor init sequence into a restartable routine.

The initsequencer routine can pick up where it left off, whether
started by _PG_init, by the internal call handler, or by a GUC hook
if the admin is trying a different config setting.

Continue moving bits out of the initializeJavaVM, etc., routines
into additional stages in the sequencer. Eventually: have a stage where
the JVM is running and a Java method can be called to check for and do
the SQL function declarations, SQLJ schema population, etc.

Ability to re-create the VM to try a new classpath is what I had hoped
for, but in many years of the JNI docs the restriction to one JVM per
process hasn't been relaxed yet, and it seems to mean you can't start
a second even after shutting down the first. So in many cases the admin
will have to exit and start a new session if installation fails at that
point. That's still not too bad.   ,  Shortcircuit assign hooks during abort.

Make sure assign hooks won't do things that could throw errors

The language handler functions are created with CREATE OR REPLACE
so they will be sure to refer to the newly-specified native library,
without requiring a cascading drop of everything depending on them.

Most of what belongs in the schema can be autogenerated into a
pljava.ddr by annotations in Commands.java. No Deployer or install.sql
to keep in sync. (For some reason the byte[] parameters had to be
explicitly SQLType'd bytea, even though the DDRProcessor type mapper
is supposed to know that. A puzzle for another day.)   ,  Fail CREATE EXTENSION on nonempty schema.

Otherwise, someone might say CREATE EXTENSION meaning
CREATE EXTENSION FROM unpackaged, and have it appear to
succeed but without packaging any of the objects.   ,  Add InstallHelper to keep hairy code from Backend.

Executive decision: attempts to ""finish"" the installation (creating
schema, language handlers, etc.) will only be made in the LOAD case.
In any other case where initialization is requested, assume things are
already set up, or explicitly being set up.   ,  PL/Java as a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension.

Because PL/Java installation is already touched off by a simple
library LOAD (even on pre-9.1 databases without the extension
framework), extension support is largely a matter of having
extension scripts that touch off a LOAD. But the library does need
to detect that case and change some behaviors slightly. When LOAD
is used directly and something fails because the settings aren't
right, Backend reports a WARNING rather than an ERROR, to make it
as easy as possible to keep explore settings and eventually get them
right, without forcing a rollback. However, under CREATE EXTENSION,
it must be reported as an error, or the extension machinery will
think all is well.

Also, playing with the settings after CREATE EXTENSION failed can
result in getting PL/Java successfully installed but not as an
extension--easily remedied with CREATE EXTENSION FROM UNPACKAGED,
so a NOTICE suggesting that is reported in that case.

The method of finding the module pathname from the LOAD argument
doesn't work under CREATE EXTENSION (ActivePortal still refers to
the CREATE EXTENSION command itself, not the LOAD command in the
script), so as a workaround the script creates a temporary table
with the module pathname in it. This turns out to be useful anyway,
because it allows distinguishing the case of PL/Java itself being
installed by CREATE EXTENSION from the case where PL/Java is already
installed and its library is getting loaded in passing during
CREATE EXTENSION for something that depends on it. (Actual support
for PL/Java-managed extensions will have to come later, but the
case needs to be recognized even to say ""you can't do that yet."")

Reorganized the archives created by pljava-packaging so files are
at directory prefixes like pljava/pkglibdir, pljava/sharedir, etc.
That makes it easy to know where things should go in a manual
installation, but also opens the possibility of a self-extracting
archive that will use pg_config to look up the corresponding paths
at extraction time.   ,  "

The Java methods related to charset encoding/decoding may be called
repeatedly, and they don't require the threadlock to be released and
reacquired. I don't measure much difference in timing (I don't really
have a good ""average text"" corpus to test on; the test case for this

Even without a compelling timing difference, the Java charset encoders/

Ok, this compiles and doesn't break any -examples tests (and will give
errors for unhandled return cases, or a warning when disregarding
domain constraints). The reason it went unnoticed so long is that
Type_getCoerce{In,Out} are really very seldom called. They are almost
dead code--fairly contrived function declarations are needed even to
force them to be called for test purposes.

That seems to be mostly because Type_getCoerce{In,Out} won't be
called if Type_canReplaceType returns true, which it very often does,
because (a) Type_fromOid silently replaces domains with their base
types, and (b) Function builds the method signature by mapping the
SQL return type to a Java type and looking for a matching method, failing
if none is found, rather than looking for a method by its name and
parameter signature only, then validating its return type. So, essentially
by construction, coercion of the return type can't ever turn out to be
necessary.

It could, however, if the AS string gives the Java return type explicitly,
and it requires coercion to the (base type of the) SQL type. SQL/JRT has
no syntax to specify the Java return type, but as an extension it seems
PL/Java does: ""Function mapping"" in the wiki gives an example where it
precedes class.method, separated by a space. Only the example doesn't
work. That's because the getAS code accepts the syntax only when the
return type is purely alphanumeric (no dots, so non-package-qualified).
Not a recent change, has been that way since 2006. An = is also accepted,
though, even after a package-qualified return type. The example works if
retried with an =.

SQL/JRT, it seems to me, specifies the other approach to method
resolution, that is, find the method by name and parameter signature,
then work out what to do with its return type, but that would be a change
to current PL/Java behavior.

The unimplemented warning for RELABELTYPE to a domain type essentially
can't be triggered, because of the way any domain is replaced by its base
type before consulting canReplaceType. That's harmless for IN parameters.
For the return type, it's a type-safety hole: a PL/Java function can
return a value that isn't valid for its declared result domain. Fixing
that should be possible, but beyond the scope of this issue.

The not-implemented errors for COERCEVIAIO and ARRAYCOERCE can be
triggered, just by constructing exactly the sort of function declarations
where you would expect those things to happen. They would still be
arguably contrived cases, where the AS string specifies a method with
different types than would naturally correspond to the SQL ones.
Nevertheless, the ""Function mappping"" wiki page says ""PL/Java will use
a standard PostgreSQL explicit cast when the SQL type of the parameter
or return value does not correspond..."" and that's not completely true
at the moment, as long as some features available in standard PostgreSQL
explicit casts, like array or I/O coercion, aren't yet implemented.
Again, beyond the scope of issue 65. At least those cases now give clear
errors, instead of crashes or Krueger numbers as I just confirmed in a
build without this change, so this does in fact fix a latent bug.

Note that the single-row result set writers used for functions that
return composite or set-of-composite results have their own coercion
logic completely unrelated to this, and implemented in SPIConnection.java.
There are more moving parts here than I had hoped....   ,  Type_getCoerceOut correct statement order.

Ken Olson pointed this out as a case of 'dead code', but in fact it was
live use of an unassigned variable just before the function call that
was going to assign it. Had to be an editing mixup, has been that way
a very long time, and has probably not caused more problems only because
it's statistically rare for a random stack location to be exactly equal
to InvalidOid.

Scratches the surface of #65. A full solution for that issue will have to
come later, but this much was an obvious Heisenbug with an obvious fix.   ,  "

Executive decision: attempts to ""finish"" the installation (creating
schema, language handlers, etc.) will only be made in the LOAD case.
In any other case where initialization is requested, assume things are
already set up, or explicitly being set up.   ,  PL/Java as a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension.

Because PL/Java installation is already touched off by a simple
library LOAD (even on pre-9.1 databases without the extension
framework), extension support is largely a matter of having
extension scripts that touch off a LOAD. But the library does need
to detect that case and change some behaviors slightly. When LOAD
is used directly and something fails because the settings aren't
right, Backend reports a WARNING rather than an ERROR, to make it
as easy as possible to keep explore settings and eventually get them
right, without forcing a rollback. However, under CREATE EXTENSION,
it must be reported as an error, or the extension machinery will
think all is well.

Also, playing with the settings after CREATE EXTENSION failed can
result in getting PL/Java successfully installed but not as an
extension--easily remedied with CREATE EXTENSION FROM UNPACKAGED,
so a NOTICE suggesting that is reported in that case.

The method of finding the module pathname from the LOAD argument
doesn't work under CREATE EXTENSION (ActivePortal still refers to
the CREATE EXTENSION command itself, not the LOAD command in the
script), so as a workaround the script creates a temporary table
with the module pathname in it. This turns out to be useful anyway,
because it allows distinguishing the case of PL/Java itself being
installed by CREATE EXTENSION from the case where PL/Java is already
installed and its library is getting loaded in passing during
CREATE EXTENSION for something that depends on it. (Actual support
for PL/Java-managed extensions will have to come later, but the
case needs to be recognized even to say ""you can't do that yet."")

Reorganized the archives created by pljava-packaging so files are
at directory prefixes like pljava/pkglibdir, pljava/sharedir, etc.
That makes it easy to know where things should go in a manual
installation, but also opens the possibility of a self-extracting
archive that will use pg_config to look up the corresponding paths
at extraction time.   ,  "

in those source files that use the STACK_BASE_PUSH / STACK_BASE_POP
macros (there is so much in miscadmin.h, I did not want to add it in
pljava.h and have it processed everywhere).

However, if enabled to run from the deployment descriptor, it does

JNI monitorexits. But that is what the code has done for years now, so
if nothing has been reported, there must not be high demand for that use

The language handler functions are created with CREATE OR REPLACE
so they will be sure to refer to the newly-specified native library,
without requiring a cascading drop of everything depending on them.

Most of what belongs in the schema can be autogenerated into a
pljava.ddr by annotations in Commands.java. No Deployer or install.sql
to keep in sync. (For some reason the byte[] parameters had to be
explicitly SQLType'd bytea, even though the DDRProcessor type mapper
is supposed to know that. A puzzle for another day.)   ,  Fail CREATE EXTENSION on nonempty schema.

Otherwise, someone might say CREATE EXTENSION meaning
CREATE EXTENSION FROM unpackaged, and have it appear to
succeed but without packaging any of the objects.   ,  Part of issue #12, schema migration.

Add a naming system for schema variants that have existed
during PL/Java's VCS history. A quick check looks at the existing
tables, if any, to infer what schema is there.

This allows a second or subsequent LOAD to succeed without trying
to recreate tables, if a quick check suggests the existing tables
are as the code expects. If an earlier PL/Java schema is recognized,
and a recipe for migrating from it is available, the schema is
migrated. (Recommendation: do PL/Java upgrade in a transaction, so
schema changes can be rolled back if something is unsatisfactory.)

The two supplied recipes handle schemas as far back as 2006-02-26,
anyway.   ,  "

Delayed by a nice pljava trivia brain teaser ... IF a function's
SQL declaration says it's immutable (or even stable, I guess), AND
you call it from the deployment descriptor install commands of the
jar that contains it, AND that's the first reference you've made to
its containing class ... ClassNotFoundException. Go ahead, explain THAT
one to Aunt Tillie.... (Hint: SPI change visibility rules.)   ,  InstallHelper groundwork() ensures good schema.

The language handler functions are created with CREATE OR REPLACE
so they will be sure to refer to the newly-specified native library,
without requiring a cascading drop of everything depending on them.

Most of what belongs in the schema can be autogenerated into a
pljava.ddr by annotations in Commands.java. No Deployer or install.sql
to keep in sync. (For some reason the byte[] parameters had to be
explicitly SQLType'd bytea, even though the DDRProcessor type mapper
is supposed to know that. A puzzle for another day.)   ,  Fix obsoleted query in sqlj.replace_jar.

Ken Olson caught this a year ago in his pull request #29, but
it was my oversight; when rearranging the sqlj relations back
in #10 to accommodate more than one deployment descriptor, I
updated the sql in install_jar and remove_jar (and deployInstall
and deployRemove), but I just totally overlooked replace_jar. Oops.   ,  SQL/JRT 2003: Jar may have > 1 deployment descr

Moving the annotation examples into pljava-examples creates a jar
with two deployment descriptors, the old one for the non-annotated
examples and the generated one. That's actually ok per SQL/JRT 2003,
but small changes to Commands.java and a new sqlj.jar_descriptors
table are needed to remove the former arbitary restriction to one
descriptor only.

Eventually the non-annotated examples could all be annotated,
leaving the generated descriptor as the only one. But as the
limit to one descriptor was at variance with the standard anyway,
it seemed worth removing.   ,  Spelling conformity

The jar_repository and jar_entry table names aren't plural, so
jar_descriptor should not be either.   ,  Run deployment descriptors in correct order.

Previously determined the order of multiple deployment descriptors in
a single jar according to the order of those entries as stored in the jar
(used in that order for install, and that order reversed for remove).

But that wasn't correct. I got my hands on 2003 and 2006 drafts of the
SQL/JRT spec and they both clearly say it is the order _as the entries
are listed in the manifest_ that matters (again, in that order for install,
and the reverse for remove).

This should be a welcome improvement, because I had noted back in
commit 0edc9e5f that maven doesn't always put things in a jar in
the same order, and that was causing the pljava-examples jar to be
broken about half the time (for autodeployment anyway). But the manifest
is a static file listing the ddrs in the right order, so as long as
maven doesn't reorder it while putting it in the jar, that behavior
should now be stable.   ,  "

The magic that makes tableOld/tableNew appear to exist under
the chosen names, for purposes of queries in SPI, happens when
SPI_register_trigger_data is called, passing the TriggerData
struct that was passed to the handler function, and that struct
has the chosen names and the tuplestores.

PL/Java doesn't do SPI_connect unless and until the called Java
function wants to use the jdbc:default:connection, at which point
the connection is created in Invocation.c and remembered for the
current level. So, that's a fine place to call SPI_register_trigger_data.
The TriggerData struct simply needs to be stashed in the current
Invocation at the time of function entry, so it can be passed to the
SPI function when the time comes.   ,  "

The 'AS' syntax for PL/Java function declarations already accepts
explicit return types as well as the parameter types, but the DDR
generator has not been emitting them. That means the magic doesn't
happen when, say, you have a Java method returning SQLXML but give
it type=""text"" in the @Function annotation. For PL/Java to notice
the automatic coercion needed there, it has to see that the Java
return type is not the one that naturally corresponds to the SQL
type ... so the Java return type needs to be included in the
signature.

Avoid, however, including the return type in the case of trigger
functions, or those that return sets or composite types. Those
already get special treatment in the function parsing code, and
the explicit return types would get in the way.   ,  Annotations doesn't support CREATE CONSTRAINT TRIGGER and clause FROM
schema.table
#138   ,  Recognize JDBC 4.2/JSR 310 types in DDR generator.   ,  Emit REMOVE section of DDR in right order (#163).

The implicitly-added provides/requires relationships between implementor
tags and the snippets that test the environment to activate or suppress
them need to be treated specially. Unlike other dependency
relationships, which have their sense reversed between the INSTALL and
REMOVE action groups, these implicit ones need to keep the same sense.
It always works better to test a condition before needing to use the
result.

The old augmentRequires method, which created the implied dependencies
by outright adding them to the snippet's other requires, is now gone;
the implied relationship is simply handled within the ordering code.
Two DAGs are created, one for install and one for remove, and an order
is found independently for each.

It's also necessary to use the deployStrings of tag-testing snippets
at undeploy time, at least in the case they don't have explicit
undeployStrings supplied, which is the usual case, because the
conditions to be tested are the same deploying and undeploying.   ,  Types.getArrayType() does the trick.   ,  Recognize type SQLXML in the annotation processor.   ,  Don't repeat yourself with UDT mappings.

It was never satisfying to define a UDT in Java through annotations
and still have the DDR generator give ""no mapping to an SQL type"" errors
for functions accepting or returning that type. It was easy enough (if
tedious) to work around by adding explicit type= or @SQLType annotations,
but the DDR generator had all the necessary information to figure that out
without such manual help. Now it does, eliminating the tedium
illustrated in jcflack/pljava-udt-type-extension@bcb5734.

To accommodate mappings added from the source being compiled, the
protoMappings collection is now of TypeMirror instances rather than
of Class instances.

Still future work: also add implied ordering dependencies for uses of
the new type (such as functions that have it as parameter or return
types and have to follow the type declaration, as illustrated in
jcflack/pljava-udt-type-extension@225ef5c, or that are named in it as,
for example, typmod in/out functions, and have to precede it).   ,  "

{} (the array of no strings). While a bit limiting, that is still
just the ticket when a RECORD-typed parameter is being used to
supply a function with an optional, arbitrary sequence of named, typed

In the case of a named row type, the default should be an array of
as many strings as the components of the type, and the strings should
be castable to the corresponding component types. The DDR generator

Yes, it is *another* pattern for objects that have Java and native state.
For now, the existing ones are being left alone. The existing patterns
do not seem to include anything for objects that are spec'd to live for
the whole transaction (as JDBC specs SQLXML to do). This pattern hooks
into PostgreSQL ResourceOwner mechanisms (and there is a TopTransaction
ResourceOwner) in order to be usable for that. If nothing blows up, it
may be possible to migrate other existing patterns to it later.   ,  Javadoc 8 nits, and other tidying.

Provide one of the short-term solutions suggested in issue #149.

As the current PreparedStatement implementation does not get the
inferred parameter types from PostgreSQL (which became possible
with SPI only as recently as PostgreSQL 9.0), its setObject method
must make a best effort to map in the other direction, finding the
PostgreSQL type that corresponds to the Java parameter value. In
one case, this is easily made much more reliable: when the Java
parameter value is an SQLData instance (a UDT), and therefore has
a getSQLTypeName method, unused until now.

Add a test method (in the ComplexTuple UDT example) to confirm that
the type is properly mapped when passed as a parameter to a
PreparedStatement.   ,  "

A Verifier can be set on a VarlenaWrapper.Output to read along as bytes
are written to the varlena, and throw an exception if they do not make a

is written to the varlena, but is, if an API requires exposing the
VarlenaWrapper.Output more or less directly to client code that could
write arbitrary content on it.

The code that implements a specific data type over varlena can create a
subclass of Verifier.Base, whose verify(InputStream) method simply reads
the whole stream and returns successfully if nothing is wrong, otherwise
throws an exception. VarlenaWrapper.Output will take care of submitting
that verify method to a thread pool, feeding it buffers of written data

There is nothing very JDBC-specific about MarkableSequenceInputStream,

mostly made up of what could be a more general ByteBufferInputStream,
so factor that out into its own class.   ,  Add VarlenaWrapper.

A VarlenaWrapper.Input presents a readable view of a detoasted
datum residing in native memory. It is constructed from native code,
specifying the memory context to (always copy or) detoast into, and
a ResourceOwner bounding the life of the native copy (which must be
released no later than the specified memory context is reset).

The available() method returns the actual detoasted size.

It would also be easy to support mark/reset, but nothing urgently
needs them at the moment.   ,  "

This is the version that takes a Class to determine the class of result

implementation method is not constrained to return an object of the
requested class, and accepts null for that argument, and all the
pre-existing methods call it that way, to get the previous behavior.

Per a comment in Type.h, it's always been the idea that TypeObtainer
methods return singletons (or return from a small number of allocated
instances, if there need to be instances with a few different typeIds).
That doesn't seem to have been followed always, but it grows in
importance with this change; certainly any new TypeClass that is added

to allocate a new Type instance every time it gets mentioned.   ,  "

Add @Override to the methods in SPIConnection that are specified
by the Connection API (to make it easier to spot the ones that
aren't). For those added in JDBC 4.1, the annotation is commented out,
as PL/Java 1.5 still strives to be buildable with Java 6. Once the
back-compatibility horizon is Java 7 or later, those @Overrides can
be uncommented.

It would also be fair to say this has added annotations (or
commented-out annotations) through JDBC 4.2, as it didn't add
any new Connection methods.

The PL/Java-specific and internal methods are now easier to pick out
(they're the ones without @Override annotations), and have some more
extensive comments about what they're doing there. Also moved one
method to be nearer the stuff it pertains to. No code changes (except

In passing, complete the implementation of the 3-argument form of
setNull (where the third argument is a PostgreSQL type name), which is
the only method on a PreparedStatement by which a parameter type can be
set to a specific PostgreSQL type (as opposed to a generic JDBC type
with some default mapping to a PostgreSQL type).

However, the implementation is still limited, in that any subsequent
non-null assignment will reset the PostgreSQL type to the default
mapping, if done through one of the pre-JDBC 4.2 setter methods, or
setObject with one of the pre-JDBC 4.2 accepted object classes. That is
to avoid a material behavior change in a minor release.

By contrast, if setObject is called with an object of one of the
newly-accepted classes (which had no prior behavior to try to match),
any already-assigned PostgreSQL type (as by setNull) will be respected,
and the setObject treated as a coercion to it (which can entail an
exception if no such coercion is available).

That new behavior ought to be the way everything behaves in some future
major release, which should use the PG 9.0 improved SPI to determine
the parameters' PostgreSQL types from what PG's type inference came up
with, and treat all the setter methods as coercions to the determined
types.   ,  Use getSQLTypeName, and add a test.

Provide one of the short-term solutions suggested in issue #149.

As the current PreparedStatement implementation does not get the
inferred parameter types from PostgreSQL (which became possible
with SPI only as recently as PostgreSQL 9.0), its setObject method
must make a best effort to map in the other direction, finding the
PostgreSQL type that corresponds to the Java parameter value. In
one case, this is easily made much more reliable: when the Java
parameter value is an SQLData instance (a UDT), and therefore has
a getSQLTypeName method, unused until now.

Add a test method (in the ComplexTuple UDT example) to confirm that
the type is properly mapped when passed as a parameter to a
PreparedStatement.   ,  "

That makes it possible for SQLXML to be implemented on top of the
recently merged JDBC 4.1/4.2 methods that allow a Class<?> parameter
to Object getter methods (and, in the other direction, can accept
objects of multiple classes and appropriately convert them to the
underlying PostgreSQL type).

This solves a problem with including SQLXML in a minor PL/Java
release: it should not change what existing application code
expects the getter methods to return for an XML type, which has
historically been String. It will still be String by default,
but an application can pass SQLXML.class to the explicit getter
methods and take advantage of this API. Function parameters and
returns can be given either type String or type SQLXML with the
expected results.

In technical terms, this means when pljava_SQLXMLImpl_initialize
calls Type_registerType2, it now passes InvalidOid instead of
XMLOID. It therefore does not become the primary mapping for XMLOID,
but does associate itself with the java.sql.SQLXML interface.
There is also a TypeBridge registered for it, which happens in
Type.c: registration of TypeBridges should happen all in that one
place, because (for now, anyway) the maintainer is responsible
for registering them in an order that does not allow a superclass/
superinterface to be found before a narrower contained type.

To comply with the API spec, SQLXML has to throw an exception if
passed to the database to be stored before being closed. However,
a SAXResult exposes no way for the caller to explicitly close it,
so wrap it in an adapter that will do so after the endDocument()
is processed.   ,  Add SQLXMLImpl.Readable.

This implements the reading (get...) operations, so it is the kind
of SQLXML instance that would be passed by PostgreSQL to a Java function
as a parameter, or retrieved from the ResultSet of a query.   ,  Test imperfectly for DOCUMENT/CONTENT in Readable.

The current stored form of XML in PostgreSQL does not save any
indication of whether the XML is in DOCUMENT or CONTENT form (which,
to determine correctly, requires fully reparsing it). Java's bundled
XML parsers do not accept the CONTENT form, requiring a synthetic
document root element to be wrapped around the stream content first,
then filtered out of the parse result. This, of course, is not necessary
if the input is in DOCUMENT form, but is harmless unless the input is in
DOCUMENT form with a DTD, in which case such wrapping must be avoided.

An imperfect test is added here that uses an input stream supporting
mark/reset, and pulls a few initial parse events before resetting the
stream for the application to parse. Those initial events only need to
be pulled until a DTD is parsed (meaning the input is definitely
DOCUMENT), or a disallowed-in-prolog production is parsed (meaning it
definitely isn't), or an element-start is parsed (meaning it could be
either, barring a full reparse to settle the question). The last two
cases can both be handled by the wrapping technique, so don't need to be
distinguished further.

The JDBC spec is mute on how SQLXML should handle DOCUMENT vs.
CONTENT. For the forms of Source that expose parse results,
wrapping and filtering is effective, but it would seem a POLA
violation to include synthetic wrapper elements via
getBinaryStream, getCharacterStream, or getString (or getSource
with StreamSource.class). So, for those cases, no wrapping.
The application code will need to know what it's doing if the
XML value might be of CONTENT form.

Because the JRE-supplied SequenceInputStream doesn't support mark/reset,
adds a (possibly general-purpose) MarkableSequenceInputStream that does,
as long as its constituent input streams do.   ,  Allow returning/storing a 'readable' SQLXML.

Relax the distinction between 'readable' and 'writable' SQLXML
instances just enough to allow a readable one passed in (or, later,
retrieved from a ResultSet) to be directly returned (or, later,
passed as a parameter or into a ResultSet), as long as it is still
readable, i.e., has not had any of the reading methods called by Java.

It can be used that way exactly once, as the native code retakes
ownership of it at that point.   ,  Add a Verifier for SQLXMLImpl.Writable.

Because the stored form in PostgreSQL of the XML data type is just its
character serialization, of all the methods offered by java.sql.SQLXML
for reading/writing the content, the ones based on strings, character
streams, and byte streams are the quickest ones to get working in a lazy
sort of way.

But the lazy way isn't appropriate for production, at least for the
writing methods, because type safety precludes letting client code write
arbitrary bytes into a varlena that PostgreSQL believes to be of XML
type. So the quick, lazy methods ultimately become the ones that need
the complexity of a Verifier making sure what is written is XML.

The other writing methods, where the serialization is done via Java XML
APIs, are left with the NoOp verifier, trusting the APIs to produce XML.   ,  Honor API spec for namespaces with getSource().

""Sources for XML parsers will have namespace processing on by default.""   ,  Add SQLXMLImpl.Writable.   ,  Ensure declaration, if any, is accurate.

The current PostgreSQL stored form for the XML type is a serialized
character string in the server encoding, still preceded by any
XMLDecl or TextDecl that preceded it, even if wrong (about the
encoding, anyway). PG's xml_out and xml_send deal with that by
replacing the decl, if any, with a newly-constructed one, and have
their own problems, but that's the basic technique reproduced here.   ,  "

This is needed because the current practice of passing the default JVM
path as a command-line macro definition to the C compiler and relying
on C preprocessor stringification to make a string literal of it only
works when the path includes no word-like components that collide with
macros in existence during the build. (Issue #176)

It seemed tidier to use scriptdef, but that plain doesn't work
from a maven-antrun-plugin configuration; the plugin writes out a
script file containing every part of the scriptdef except the script.

The bug report hasn't been assigned yet...
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MANTRUN-207

too bad, as the only problem looks to be right here:

So, for now, this is done with a script tag, no scriptdef.   ,  "

Still has a public getNativePointer() because Relation, TriggerData,
SQLOutputToTuple, and SingleRowWriter refer to it.

In passing, it appears that TupleTable is implemented by constructing
a Java array populated with individual Java Tuple instances,
one for every tuple in the table.

There's got to be a lazier way....   ,  DualState-ify ErrorData.   ,  DualState-ify TupleDesc.

Still has a public getNativePointer() because both SingleRowReader
and Tuple refer to it.   ,  Prepare to migrate to DualState from other idioms.

Older code where a Java object is associated with some native state has
been using some combination of Object.finalize() (deprecated for removal
in newer Java environments), JavaWrapper, Invocation_createLocalWrapper,
with a lot of details scattered in a lot of places, and not a lot of
explanation.

The DualState mechanism introduced with VarlenaWrapper should be able
to subsume all of those cases, eliminate the use of Object.finalize,
and reduce (maybe eliminate?) the use of JNI from threads other than
the main PG thread.

Prepare the way by declaring that the ""resource owner"" associated with
a DualState does not have to be only a PG ResourceOwner. It can also be
the address of some other sort of allocated struct that has a scope-like
behavior. In PG 9.5 and later, a MemoryContext with a
MemoryContextCallback could serve, and PL/Java's currentInvocation can
be used to scope a state to the currently-executing PL/Java function.
Unless the memory allocator's broken, such alternative allocated
addresses won't be mistakable for actual ResourceOwners, so no special
magic should be needed for DualState objects scoped in any of those ways
to coexist.

In passing, change the queue implementation for s_liveInstances in
DualState. LinkedBlockingDeque was more heavyweight than needed; it
was chosen in haste after starting with ConcurrentLinkedDeque and then
finding it wasn't in Java 6, but ConcurrentLinkedQueue is, and has all
the capabilities needed. Its iterator().remove() method really runs in
constant amortized time, as it just leaves the unlinking to be done on
a subsequent traversal, which happens regularly in our case.

If it can be proven that no manipulation of s_liveInstances will happen
except on one thread interacting with PG, it could be overkill to be
using a concurrent queue at all.

Get rid of HeapTupleHeader.java, which has been dead since a4f6c9e.   ,  An optimization for non-transient native scopes.

DualState works when NULL is passed as a resource owner, in which
case the native state had better be in some long-lived area like
JavaMemoryContext, because no call to nativeRelease with a real pointer
will ever match it, so javaStateUnreachable or javaStateReleased will
be the only ways it can be freed. (It follows that any DualState flavor
that will be used that way had better have a freeing action as part
of its javaStateUnreachable / javaStateReleased.)

It seems preferable to keep things in more tightly scoped contexts and
give them real owners, but this pattern was used in enough of the
former-JavaWrapper cases just migrated that it's worth supporting
(at least until further analysis can migrate some of those to use
appropriate scopes).

So, a worthwhile optimization is to track objects that lack resource
owners in a simpler data structure, that does not need to support any
retrieval by resource owner. They still have to be kept live somehow
(otherwise Java forgets about them and will not enqueue them when their
referents are unreachable), but a simple IdentityHashMap suffices, and
they can be removed in O(1) when found unreachable or released by Java.

For objects with resource owners, the tracking structure is now a hash
map from owner to doubly-linked list of the associated instances. The
list is directly implemented with prev and next references in the
instances themselves, rather than using a Collections class, so that
when an instance is found unreachable or released from Java, it also can
be removed from the list in O(1) with no searching. Exit of the native
resource owner scope is, of course, handled by looking up the owner in
the map and processing every instance remaining on the list.

The structures used now are plain vanilla java.util implementations with
no claimed thread safety properties (and the same is true of the
directly-implemented doubly-linked list code). The Javadoc now explains
at length the usage requirements that must be observed for the design to
be safe.   ,  Expose some DualState statistics as an MBean.   ,  "

The mechanism for fudging the stack base to mollify PostgreSQL's
stack depth check when the Java thread executing in PG changes
(only possible when pljava.java_thread_pg_entry is 'allow') has
long involved computing the System.identityHashCode() of the
current Thread object, and passing that to the native code to
be compared to that of the last known thread running in PG code.

That was unnecessarily roundabout, given that every native method
call passes a JNIEnv pointer to the native code, which the JNI spec
""design overview"" clarifies to be valid only per thread, while
guaranteeing to pass the same pointer in calls from the same thread,
so it has the properties needed of an ID.   ,  DualState-ify ExecutionPlan.   ,  "

What the TypeMapper was doing was correct for a function return value,
matching the return value to the narrowest mapped type that the actual
return value could be assigned to.

It was not correct for a function parameter, which needs to be matched
to the widest mapped type that could be assigned to the parameter.

Jens, if you ever read this, forgive me. At least I caught it quickly.   ,  Snippet implicitly requires its implementor-name.

That way, a snippet that will test some condition and enable that
implementor-name at install time can be declared to provide it, and
be emitted earlier. However, not to insist on supplying a snippet
that explicitly provides every implementor name ... some could just
be selected by the user with SET LOCAL pljava.implementors TO ...
before installing. So the implicit requirement will be counted in
indegree initially, to delay such a snippet as far as practical, but
only until a cycle-breaker releases it when no other progress can
be made.   ,  SQL generator now reports require cycles usefully.

Should have done that all along.   ,  Now Snippet can carry implementor-name.

Nothing sets it yet, but it now defaults to PostgreSQL for everything, in
recognition of the fact that hardly any of the PG SQL code that gets
generated here will be in the exact ISO-prescribed syntax of the exact
five allowed, unadorned SQL statements.

Yes, that makes DDR files bigger. The zip format will compress them well.   ,  Changes are required because of move of GETSTRUCT() and timeout
handling framework changes done in PG 9.3. Along with that I fixes
minor issue in DDRProcessor.java that is causing ""illegal start of
expression"" error. Maven did not worked for me to build it and hang
endlessly while building c source code (pljava-so). As a workaround I
temporarily fixed makefiles to test PG9.3 related fix that seems
worked and generated pljava.jar and pljava.so files and their basic
sanity seems working fine.   ,  Add a class annotation to make a base/scalar UDT.

- Add the annotation, have DDRProcessor recognize it.
- Check the annotated class for the required properties and members.
- The snippets map formerly allowed only one type of annotation on
  a given element. That happened to work, but not now when a class
  could have both a UDT and a SQLAction annotation, for example.
  Adapt the map to key by element and snippet class, so snippets
  of different classes can be hung on an element and selectively
  retrieved.
- An old comment in populateAnnotationImpl suggested it would reduce
  boilerplate setter code if, failing to find a setter method, the
  field itself could be reflectively looked up and stored. That's done
  now, so setter methods are needed only when something more special
  has to be done.
- Function declarations will be synthesized automagically for the four
  mandatory (in, out, recv, send) methods, but to allow their properties
  to be individually adjusted, they can still accept Function
  annotations. That's done by hanging a new subclass of FunctionImpl on
  those elements, that generates the right special form of declaration,
  and has setters that refuse changes to certain properties where that
  wouldn't make sense.
- Treat the default implementor-tag (PostgreSQL if not changed with new
  ddr.implementor command line property) specially. Now that everything
  is getting wrapped with an implementor tag by default, the implied
  requires=""implementor-tag"" was holding everything back until released
  by the cycle-breaker, sometimes in puzzling order. The implementor tag
  that happens to be the default one should /not/ be treated as a
  pending requirement.
- Move ComplexScalar to annotation subpackage, in preparation for
  revamping it as an annotation example. So git won't lose track of it,
  this is a breaking change, to be fixed in the next commit with edits
  corresponding to the move.   ,  Conform to BaseUDT rename, add MappedUDT.

Supporting MappedUDT is much simpler. It emits a
CREATE TYPE foo AS ( ... structure ... )
if a structure is provided, or not, if it isn't, followed by a
SELECT sqlj.add_type_mapping( ... ), and that's it.

Much javadoc also added.

This commit ends with pure renames of the Point and ComplexTuple
examples in preparation to make them annotation examples ... breaking
compilation until they are fixed up in the next commit, but git can
see where they went.   ,  Workaround the problem reported in #39.

The annotation processor in javac runs in multiple 'rounds', as long as
generated source files keep appearing, and one final round after they
don't. This code used to save some mapping of Class objects to the
javax.lang.model objects (TypeElement/TypeMirror) until the final round,
which worked in Java 6, but as of 7 one gets back different model objects
in different rounds, for the same types, and they don't match, so type
mapping breaks.

This workaround moves all those lookups to before or during round 1, when
a consistent set of model objects can be looked up. So, it will work as
long as all the source files that might contain pljava annotations will be
found in round 1. That should always be the case unless someone is using a
very fancy build with _other_ annotation processors generating new source
files with pljava annotations that have to be processed in additional
rounds. For now, that won't work, because their types won't seem to match
what was computed in round 1. So don't do that.

http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8038455 might refer
to this problem, and promises a fix in Java 9, for what it's worth.   ,  Update annotation-driven SQL generation to Java 6.

Remove the dependency on org.objectweb.asm in favor of the
annotation processing facilities now built in to javac as of
Java 6. Add annotations to override the auto-determined type
for function parameters and/or supply default values, and to
supply arbitrary SQL commands to be included in the generated
deployment descriptor.   ,  "

For now, nothing done but to dump the annotated examples in with
the other ones (and change the name of one method that duplicated
one of the non-annotated ones), and further annotate the trigger
example to create the tables it refers to. (Also, one example
referred to an example.properties file, so one has been created.)

For now, the result is a jar with two deployment descriptors (which
is supposed to be ok per SQL/JRT 2003, so is now accepted): the
original one and the generated one.

Notes on things I know aren't perfect yet:

1. Maven doesn't put things in the jar in a deterministic order.
The generated ddr depends on the javatest schema and _properties
type created in the old ddr, but sometimes ""mvn clean install"" will
put the two ddrs in the jar in the other order. This is just a
maven issue; pljava correctly follows the spec and uses the order of
the ddrs found in the jar. It wouldn't be a problem if the two ddrs
had no interdependencies, or if the maven build could be tweaked
to force a certain order in the jar, or if the old ddr were done away
with entirely by annotating all the old examples so the generator
generates everything.

2. The generated ddr only reflects annotations seen in the compile run.
If a non-clean build run only runs javac on a few changed files, the
generated ddr can be incomplete. So for now it's best to run javac on
everything (or do a mvn clean before building). There may be a way to
improve the annotation processor to save a record of all the files that
would need to be reexamined in a partial rebuild. What I don't know yet
is how (or whether) that can be communicated back to javac to get those
files examined in a later round.

3. Naturally until issue #8 is fixed, none of the no-arg example
functions can actually be used.

4. The old examples.ddr contains a set search_path making javatest the
current schema, which causes deployRemove to fail later. The trouble is
that if deployRemove alters the search path on the current schema, it will
try to restore the old value after undeploying, and that fails if the
undeploy made that schema go away. Possibly deployRemove could be made to
just fail silently if that happens, but that's an issue for another day.   ,  "

By omitting the linked-in dependency on libjvm, pljava can now successfully
load and then use PostgreSQL's own dlopen wrapper to find libjvm using the
pljava.libjvm_location option, or give a helpful error report.

across PG releases.   ,  PL/Java as a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension.

Because PL/Java installation is already touched off by a simple
library LOAD (even on pre-9.1 databases without the extension
framework), extension support is largely a matter of having
extension scripts that touch off a LOAD. But the library does need
to detect that case and change some behaviors slightly. When LOAD
is used directly and something fails because the settings aren't
right, Backend reports a WARNING rather than an ERROR, to make it
as easy as possible to keep explore settings and eventually get them
right, without forcing a rollback. However, under CREATE EXTENSION,
it must be reported as an error, or the extension machinery will
think all is well.

Also, playing with the settings after CREATE EXTENSION failed can
result in getting PL/Java successfully installed but not as an
extension--easily remedied with CREATE EXTENSION FROM UNPACKAGED,
so a NOTICE suggesting that is reported in that case.

The method of finding the module pathname from the LOAD argument
doesn't work under CREATE EXTENSION (ActivePortal still refers to
the CREATE EXTENSION command itself, not the LOAD command in the
script), so as a workaround the script creates a temporary table
with the module pathname in it. This turns out to be useful anyway,
because it allows distinguishing the case of PL/Java itself being
installed by CREATE EXTENSION from the case where PL/Java is already
installed and its library is getting loaded in passing during
CREATE EXTENSION for something that depends on it. (Actual support
for PL/Java-managed extensions will have to come later, but the
case needs to be recognized even to say ""you can't do that yet."")

Reorganized the archives created by pljava-packaging so files are
at directory prefixes like pljava/pkglibdir, pljava/sharedir, etc.
That makes it easy to know where things should go in a manual
installation, but also opens the possibility of a self-extracting
archive that will use pg_config to look up the corresponding paths
at extraction time.   ,  MSVC profile using profile more, properties less.

This will have to be tested by someone with MSVC access. Its behavior
should be close to what I _think_ it should do. Possible nits: it puts
the MSVC extra include paths late in the list; if that's a problem
because they need to be early, I found syntax for that too, only a
little bit uglier. Also, an MSVC link will mention libjvm twice, once
in the right place (I think), but also still in the wrong one; I _think_
that should be harmless. Nothing another barrage of XML can't fix, if
it's a problem.   ,  Proclaim a default for pljava.classpath.

There may as well be an understood place to put the jar file so
the variable need not always be set.   ,  Workaround Windows creating_extension visibility.

Should now detect (in most cases?) when an extension is
being created, even in versions where creating_extension
isn't visible in Windows. Test depends on seeing the command
in ActivePortal; I am not sure what contexts could be contrived
where that wouldn't work right, but ordinary foreseeable cases
seem to work.

Got rid of pljavaInExtension: the idea that two cases have to be
distinguished (loading PL/Java itself as an extension, or using it
in the creation of some other extension) was sound, but the second
case isn't something that can be checked once at load time; it needs
a backend function that sqlj.install_jar can invoke whenever needed.   ,  Begin improving message helpfulness.

Some GUC hooks allow easily resuming the process if a setting
needed to be changed (as LOAD is a no-op after the first time,
so that isn't a way to try again).   ,  Begin new build and installation instructions.

Also document the existing examples, and add a new one, a fully worked
hello, world to demonstrate building, install_jar, and set_classpath.

Also add pljava.enable to simplify <9.2 installs, as explained in the
docs.

Alter the errhint for saving the settings in the <9.2 case.
Saving the settings with ALTER DATABASE ... SET won't work there, they
have to go in postgresql.conf.

Also masks the exact postgresql.conf path if the user isn't superuser.
I'm fairly sure there's no code path to produce this message if the user
isn't superuser, but a simple check is more readable than a proof.   ,  Conditional DDR as proposed on pljava-dev.

Delayed by a nice pljava trivia brain teaser ... IF a function's
SQL declaration says it's immutable (or even stable, I guess), AND
you call it from the deployment descriptor install commands of the
jar that contains it, AND that's the first reference you've made to
its containing class ... ClassNotFoundException. Go ahead, explain THAT
one to Aunt Tillie.... (Hint: SPI change visibility rules.)   ,  Add InstallHelper to keep hairy code from Backend.

Executive decision: attempts to ""finish"" the installation (creating
schema, language handlers, etc.) will only be made in the LOAD case.
In any other case where initialization is requested, assume things are
already set up, or explicitly being set up.   ,  Factor init sequence into a restartable routine.

The initsequencer routine can pick up where it left off, whether
started by _PG_init, by the internal call handler, or by a GUC hook
if the admin is trying a different config setting.

Continue moving bits out of the initializeJavaVM, etc., routines
into additional stages in the sequencer. Eventually: have a stage where
the JVM is running and a Java method can be called to check for and do
the SQL function declarations, SQLJ schema population, etc.

Ability to re-create the VM to try a new classpath is what I had hoped
for, but in many years of the JNI docs the restriction to one JVM per
process hasn't been relaxed yet, and it seems to mean you can't start
a second even after shutting down the first. So in many cases the admin
will have to exit and start a new session if installation fails at that
point. That's still not too bad.   ,  Shortcircuit assign hooks during abort.

Make sure assign hooks won't do things that could throw errors
during transaction abort.   ,  "

Ok, this compiles and doesn't break any -examples tests (and will give
errors for unhandled return cases, or a warning when disregarding
domain constraints). The reason it went unnoticed so long is that
Type_getCoerce{In,Out} are really very seldom called. They are almost
dead code--fairly contrived function declarations are needed even to
force them to be called for test purposes.

That seems to be mostly because Type_getCoerce{In,Out} won't be
called if Type_canReplaceType returns true, which it very often does,
because (a) Type_fromOid silently replaces domains with their base
types, and (b) Function builds the method signature by mapping the
SQL return type to a Java type and looking for a matching method, failing
if none is found, rather than looking for a method by its name and
parameter signature only, then validating its return type. So, essentially
by construction, coercion of the return type can't ever turn out to be
necessary.

It could, however, if the AS string gives the Java return type explicitly,
and it requires coercion to the (base type of the) SQL type. SQL/JRT has
no syntax to specify the Java return type, but as an extension it seems
PL/Java does: ""Function mapping"" in the wiki gives an example where it
precedes class.method, separated by a space. Only the example doesn't
work. That's because the getAS code accepts the syntax only when the
return type is purely alphanumeric (no dots, so non-package-qualified).
Not a recent change, has been that way since 2006. An = is also accepted,
though, even after a package-qualified return type. The example works if
retried with an =.

SQL/JRT, it seems to me, specifies the other approach to method
resolution, that is, find the method by name and parameter signature,
then work out what to do with its return type, but that would be a change
to current PL/Java behavior.

The unimplemented warning for RELABELTYPE to a domain type essentially
can't be triggered, because of the way any domain is replaced by its base
type before consulting canReplaceType. That's harmless for IN parameters.
For the return type, it's a type-safety hole: a PL/Java function can
return a value that isn't valid for its declared result domain. Fixing
that should be possible, but beyond the scope of this issue.

The not-implemented errors for COERCEVIAIO and ARRAYCOERCE can be
triggered, just by constructing exactly the sort of function declarations
where you would expect those things to happen. They would still be
arguably contrived cases, where the AS string specifies a method with
different types than would naturally correspond to the SQL ones.
Nevertheless, the ""Function mappping"" wiki page says ""PL/Java will use
a standard PostgreSQL explicit cast when the SQL type of the parameter
or return value does not correspond..."" and that's not completely true
at the moment, as long as some features available in standard PostgreSQL
explicit casts, like array or I/O coercion, aren't yet implemented.
Again, beyond the scope of issue 65. At least those cases now give clear
errors, instead of crashes or Krueger numbers as I just confirmed in a
build without this change, so this does in fact fix a latent bug.

Note that the single-row result set writers used for functions that
return composite or set-of-composite results have their own coercion
logic completely unrelated to this, and implemented in SPIConnection.java.
There are more moving parts here than I had hoped....   ,  Type_getCoerceOut correct statement order.

Ken Olson pointed this out as a case of 'dead code', but in fact it was
live use of an unassigned variable just before the function call that
was going to assign it. Had to be an editing mixup, has been that way
a very long time, and has probably not caused more problems only because
it's statistically rare for a random stack location to be exactly equal
to InvalidOid.

Scratches the surface of #65. A full solution for that issue will have to
come later, but this much was an obvious Heisenbug with an obvious fix.   ,  "

Executive decision: attempts to ""finish"" the installation (creating
schema, language handlers, etc.) will only be made in the LOAD case.
In any other case where initialization is requested, assume things are
already set up, or explicitly being set up.   ,  PL/Java as a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension.

Because PL/Java installation is already touched off by a simple
library LOAD (even on pre-9.1 databases without the extension
framework), extension support is largely a matter of having
extension scripts that touch off a LOAD. But the library does need
to detect that case and change some behaviors slightly. When LOAD
is used directly and something fails because the settings aren't
right, Backend reports a WARNING rather than an ERROR, to make it
as easy as possible to keep explore settings and eventually get them
right, without forcing a rollback. However, under CREATE EXTENSION,
it must be reported as an error, or the extension machinery will
think all is well.

Also, playing with the settings after CREATE EXTENSION failed can
result in getting PL/Java successfully installed but not as an
extension--easily remedied with CREATE EXTENSION FROM UNPACKAGED,
so a NOTICE suggesting that is reported in that case.

The method of finding the module pathname from the LOAD argument
doesn't work under CREATE EXTENSION (ActivePortal still refers to
the CREATE EXTENSION command itself, not the LOAD command in the
script), so as a workaround the script creates a temporary table
with the module pathname in it. This turns out to be useful anyway,
because it allows distinguishing the case of PL/Java itself being
installed by CREATE EXTENSION from the case where PL/Java is already
installed and its library is getting loaded in passing during
CREATE EXTENSION for something that depends on it. (Actual support
for PL/Java-managed extensions will have to come later, but the
case needs to be recognized even to say ""you can't do that yet."")

Reorganized the archives created by pljava-packaging so files are
at directory prefixes like pljava/pkglibdir, pljava/sharedir, etc.
That makes it easy to know where things should go in a manual
installation, but also opens the possibility of a self-extracting
archive that will use pg_config to look up the corresponding paths
at extraction time.   ,  "

The language handler functions are created with CREATE OR REPLACE
so they will be sure to refer to the newly-specified native library,
without requiring a cascading drop of everything depending on them.

Most of what belongs in the schema can be autogenerated into a
pljava.ddr by annotations in Commands.java. No Deployer or install.sql
to keep in sync. (For some reason the byte[] parameters had to be
explicitly SQLType'd bytea, even though the DDRProcessor type mapper
is supposed to know that. A puzzle for another day.)   ,  Fail CREATE EXTENSION on nonempty schema.

Otherwise, someone might say CREATE EXTENSION meaning
CREATE EXTENSION FROM unpackaged, and have it appear to
succeed but without packaging any of the objects.   ,  Part of issue #12, schema migration.

Add a naming system for schema variants that have existed
during PL/Java's VCS history. A quick check looks at the existing
tables, if any, to infer what schema is there.

This allows a second or subsequent LOAD to succeed without trying
to recreate tables, if a quick check suggests the existing tables
are as the code expects. If an earlier PL/Java schema is recognized,
and a recipe for migrating from it is available, the schema is
migrated. (Recommendation: do PL/Java upgrade in a transaction, so
schema changes can be rolled back if something is unsatisfactory.)

The two supplied recipes handle schemas as far back as 2006-02-26,
anyway.   ,  "

Delayed by a nice pljava trivia brain teaser ... IF a function's
SQL declaration says it's immutable (or even stable, I guess), AND
you call it from the deployment descriptor install commands of the
jar that contains it, AND that's the first reference you've made to
its containing class ... ClassNotFoundException. Go ahead, explain THAT
one to Aunt Tillie.... (Hint: SPI change visibility rules.)   ,  InstallHelper groundwork() ensures good schema.

The language handler functions are created with CREATE OR REPLACE
so they will be sure to refer to the newly-specified native library,
without requiring a cascading drop of everything depending on them.

Most of what belongs in the schema can be autogenerated into a
pljava.ddr by annotations in Commands.java. No Deployer or install.sql
to keep in sync. (For some reason the byte[] parameters had to be
explicitly SQLType'd bytea, even though the DDRProcessor type mapper
is supposed to know that. A puzzle for another day.)   ,  Fix obsoleted query in sqlj.replace_jar.

Ken Olson caught this a year ago in his pull request #29, but
it was my oversight; when rearranging the sqlj relations back
in #10 to accommodate more than one deployment descriptor, I
updated the sql in install_jar and remove_jar (and deployInstall
and deployRemove), but I just totally overlooked replace_jar. Oops.   ,  SQL/JRT 2003: Jar may have > 1 deployment descr

Moving the annotation examples into pljava-examples creates a jar
with two deployment descriptors, the old one for the non-annotated
examples and the generated one. That's actually ok per SQL/JRT 2003,
but small changes to Commands.java and a new sqlj.jar_descriptors
table are needed to remove the former arbitary restriction to one
descriptor only.

Eventually the non-annotated examples could all be annotated,
leaving the generated descriptor as the only one. But as the
limit to one descriptor was at variance with the standard anyway,
it seemed worth removing.   ,  Spelling conformity

The jar_repository and jar_entry table names aren't plural, so
jar_descriptor should not be either.   ,  Run deployment descriptors in correct order.

Previously determined the order of multiple deployment descriptors in
a single jar according to the order of those entries as stored in the jar
(used in that order for install, and that order reversed for remove).

But that wasn't correct. I got my hands on 2003 and 2006 drafts of the
SQL/JRT spec and they both clearly say it is the order _as the entries
are listed in the manifest_ that matters (again, in that order for install,
and the reverse for remove).

This should be a welcome improvement, because I had noted back in
commit 0edc9e5f that maven doesn't always put things in a jar in
the same order, and that was causing the pljava-examples jar to be
broken about half the time (for autodeployment anyway). But the manifest
is a static file listing the ddrs in the right order, so as long as
maven doesn't reorder it while putting it in the jar, that behavior
should now be stable.   ,  "
