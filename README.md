Replication Utilities 

This repository includes the steps and information needed to replicate our study.

1- Detection of multi-language code smells occurrences.

2- Detection of bug fixing and bug inducing commits.

3- Extraction of bug topics.

4- Statistical Analysis performed.

This project aims to investigate the evolution of multi-language design smells and the relation between these smells and software fault-proneness.

- Detection of multi-language code smells occurrences
Location: Folder Detection Approach

Approach: Detection Approach
Results: Results of the detection
Evaluation: Evaluation of the Approach

Getting Started

Running

Run /MLS SDD/src/mlssad/DetectCodeSmellsAndAntiPatterns.java with the path to a directory or file as the only argument. The program will output a CSV file with the code smells and anti-patterns detected in the input source.

Customizing

Change the parameters in /MLS SDD/rsc/config.properties to adapt to your needs. It is currently configured following the default values as thresholds.

Running the tests

The directory /MLS SDD Tests contains tests for each code smell and anti-pattern individually, and two test suites (Applied with the PilotProject). 

The tests require the pilot project for detection of anti-patterns and code smells in multi-language systems:

1- Clone the pilot project (PilotProjectAPCSMLS).

2- Create a junction between the folder MLS SDD Tests/rsc and the pilot project folder. On Windows, assuming that the two projects are in the same folder (otherwise, include their paths):
MKLINK /D /J "MLS-SDD\MLS SDD Tests\rsc" "PilotProjectAPCSMLS"

Dependencies

- Detection of bug fixing and bug inducing commits
Location: Folder Detection of Bugs
Scripts: Contains the script used to extract the bugs
Results: Contains the results of the bug information with the smells
Evaluation: Contains the manual evaluation of the detection approach

Getting Started
Run the script 	Bug_InducingCommits.py to extract the bug information using Pydriller related to a specific project.
Manual validation of commit inducing of Pydriller and comparison with szz results.

- Extraction of bug topics.
Approach: Combination of python script and manual analysis
Results: Results of the topics and the manual validation
Getting Started
Input file of the commit messages ‘commit-messages.csv’.
Download Mallet.
Run the script “LDA_Latest.py” with the input file.
Manual Validation and attribution of tags and keywords.
